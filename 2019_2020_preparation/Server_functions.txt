2) Changes in global fight log trigger - change player's properties based on the log.
3) Every day trigger (shop reset, adventure surfaces, tournaments, ...) - turn off server
4) Web listener (releases, ...)
5) In app messages, push in messages, notifications in general
6) Action on loading from document? - when any faction is loaded - clear the log older than 7 days...

Note: we're theoretically able to disable server for few hours and just run some sort of cleaner, 
however I feel like that would not be the perfect solution and would prefer something elastic
